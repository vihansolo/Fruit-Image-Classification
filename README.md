# Fruit-Image-Classification
 This is an Image Classification Project performed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Tensorflow Keras libraries. The main objective of the classification is to create a model which categorizes the images into three categories of fruits - cherry, strawberry, and tomato.

To create a model:

1. Run the train script using "python train.py"
	1.1. Creates a model inside "model/"

2. Run the test script using "python test.py"
