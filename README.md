# Fruit-Image-Classification
 This is an Image Classification Project performed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Tensorflow Keras libraries. The main objective of the classification is to create a model which categorizes the images into three categories of fruits - cherry, strawberry, and tomato.

To create a model:

- Run the train script using "python train.py"
    - Creates a model inside "model/"

- Run the test script using "python test.py" to check the classification on the test images.

The exisiting model accuracy is 66.67 %.
